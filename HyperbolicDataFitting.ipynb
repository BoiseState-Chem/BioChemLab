    "- Comments that start with \"#\" (typically shown in green font) tell you what the lines of code right below the comment do.\n",
    "- Blocks of comments that start with \"TODO\" (typically shown in orange font) tell you what you need to change/edit in the lines of code right below the comment. The to-do items within a section of code should be addressed before running that section. **There are a total of 4 TODO items throughout this entire notebook.**\n",
    "    - Note: If a section of code does not contain a TODO comment, there is nothing that needs to be edited, and you can simply run that section."
